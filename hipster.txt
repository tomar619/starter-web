Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! That's my family Kay, that's not me. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? It's not personal. It's business.
